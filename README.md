# MOPSO_CloudSim

Implementation of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization using cloudsim.

following research is used in our code:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313804265_Efficient_Task_Scheduling_Multi-Objective_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_in_Cloud_Computing

Basic PSO code of https://github.com/James2356/cloudsim-task-scheduling is being used and then modified for multi-objective(tec,ect,vmallocation).
